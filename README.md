# OS-Assignment-04
This assignment explores automating C/C++ program compilation with Makefiles and benchmarking sequential and parallel implementations. Matrix multiplication programs are developed using Sequential, Pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI, and tested across varying matrix sizes to analyze performance and scalability.

Students may also replace matrix multiplication with alternative algorithms, such as sorting, to evaluate parallel efficiency. The exercise provides practical experience in parallel programming, Makefile automation, and performance analysis.
